## 2. Introduction and fundamentals

### D23-T01 UploadFile

**Definition.** UploadFile in production FastAPI services refers to the practice of uploadfile with PostgreSQL, async-aware handlers, and clear operational boundaries.

## 3. Internal workings

Requests enter ASGI middleware, resolve dependencies, execute the route, serialize the response, and run yield dependency teardown. Failures before commit should rollback database work. Worker processes do not share in-memory caches, counters, or BackgroundTasks state.

## 4. Architecture diagrams

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant R as Route
  participant D as get_db
  participant S as Session
  participant P as Pool
  participant PG as PostgreSQL
  R->>D: enter
  D->>S: open
  S->>P: checkout
  P->>PG: query
  R->>D: exit
  D->>S: commit or rollback
  D->>S: close
```

The diagram anchors discussion for this chapter; combine it with logs and traces to find which hop failed.

## 5. Code and implementation

All examples below are **UNVERIFIED** in this workspace (date context: 2026-10-13).

```python
MAX_BYTES = 10 * 1024 * 1024

async def save_upload(file: UploadFile):
    if file.size and file.size > MAX_BYTES:
        raise HTTPException(413)
    safe_name = Path(file.filename or "upload").name
```

## 6. API contracts

Where endpoints are illustrated, use Problem Details (RFC 9457) for errors, explicit auth on mutating routes, and idempotency keys for retry-safe creates (RFC 9110 semantics).

## 7. Production considerations

**Mandatory:** input validation (Pydantic v2), authentication separate from authorization, timeouts on outbound calls, least-privilege credentials, structured logs with request IDs.

**Optional:** feature flags, canary deploys, redaction filters, cost dashboards for AI paths.

## 8. Comparison and tradeoffs

| Approach | Benefit | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In-process shortcut | Fast to ship | Not durable across restarts; poor for long work |
| Queue + database row | Durable, observable | Operational complexity |
| Sync stack in `def` routes | Simple libraries | Thread pool limits under load |

## 9. Debugging and troubleshooting

**Symptom:** elevated 5xx or stalled requests. **Cause:** pool exhaustion, blocking in `async def`, or missing rollback. **Reproduce:** single-request trace plus pool metrics. **Fix:** close sessions, offload blocking work, right-size pools. **Prevention:** integration tests and load tests in CI.

## 10. Interview preparation

**Intermediate.** How does FastAPI clean up a database session?  
**Model answer.** A `yield` dependency commits on success, rolls back on exceptions, and closes the session in `finally`, returning the connection to the pool.  
**Incorrect answer.** "Garbage collection closes connections."

**Advanced.** Why must job consumers be idempotent?  
**Model answer.** Brokers may deliver duplicates; retries replay work. Idempotency keys and unique constraints prevent double side effects.  
**Follow-up.** Where do you store idempotency state? Prefer the primary database or a dedicated store with TTL, not worker RAM.

## 11. Exercises and mastery assessment

1. **Conceptual.** Name three components that must not rely on in-memory state shared across Uvicorn workers.  
2. **Coding.** Sketch a dependency that yields an `AsyncSession` with rollback on error (UNVERIFIED).  
3. **Debugging.** `QueuePool timeout` during traffic spike—list two causes and two fixes.  
4. **Design.** Choose BackgroundTasks versus a queue for a 30-second PDF job.

**Solutions.** 1) Rate-limit counters, dedupe caches, BackgroundTasks completion flags. 2) `try: yield session; await commit except: rollback finally: close`. 3) Leaked sessions; pool too small—increase pool budget carefully or fix leaks. 4) Queue with DB row; not BackgroundTasks.

**Mastery checklist.**

- Explain request-scoped session lifecycle.
- State when async versus sync routes are appropriate.
- Describe durable job state versus in-process tasks.

**Revision summary.** UploadFile, Forms, Limits, and Streaming Uploads ties handbook topics to production-safe FastAPI patterns: validate early, bound resources, persist important state in PostgreSQL, and assume duplicate delivery for async work.
